----
This is a fork of https://github.com/leodesigner/esp_mesh_mqtt_gateway \
adapted to be installed as a Home Assistant Add-on.

It can run as a HA Add-on, or stand-alone, on the RaspberryPI, OrangePI or any capable machine.

### Install as Home Assistant Add-on
- Install and configure Samba or SSH Add-ons
- Create the folder: `/addons/espnow2mqtt`
- Copy the files from here into that folder
- In HA, open the "Add-on store"
- On the top right overflow menu, click the "Check for updates" button
- You should now see a new section at the top of the store called "Local add-ons"
- Install it, open it, and go to the "Configuration" tab
- Edit your configuration, save and (re)start

Currently, there is no implementation of the `stats_listener.py` script in this Add-on.

### Running stand-alone
- Clone or download the files to a suitable folder
- Rename the configuration file: `gw-config-template.json` to: `gw-config.json` 
- Edit the configuration
- Create a Python venv in that folder: `python3 -m venv venv`
- Activate the venv:  `source venv/bin/activate`
- Install the requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Deactivate the venv: `deactivate`
- Start the gateway: `./start.sh`
